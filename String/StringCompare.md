# There are three ways to compare String in java: 

1. By using equals() method 
2. By using == operator
3. By compareTo() method

## using equals() method 

`code`<br> 
1(way). `public boolean equals(Object another )  compares this string to the specified object` <br>
2(way). `public boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String another) compares this string to another string, ignoring case.`
